# **Oral2**
This github repo is to publicly release the code of oral2.

## Install

Create the virtualenv (you can also use conda) and install the dependencies of *requirements.txt*

```
python -m venv env
env/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir data
```
Then you can download the oral coco-dataset (both images and json file) from TODO-put-link. Copy them into `data` folder and unzip the file `oral1.zip`.

## Usage
Regarding the usage of this repo, in order to reproduce the experiments, we organize the workflow in two part: (i) data preparation and (ii) deep learning experiments.

### Data preparation
Due to the possibility of errors in the dataset, such as missing images, run the check-dataset.py script to detect such errors. Returns the elements to be removed from the json file (this can be done manually or via a script).
```
python -m scripts.check-dataset --dataset data\coco_dataset.json
```
In this work, the dataset was annotated with more labels than necessary. Some are grouped under more general labels. To aggregate all the labels of the three diseases studied in this work, the following script is executed. In addition, we split the dataset with the holdout method.
```
python -m scripts.simplify-dataset --folder data
python -m scripts.split-dataset --folder data
```

You can use the `dataset-stats.py` script to print the class occurrences for each dataset.
```
python -m scripts.dataset-stats --dataset data\dataset.json # entire dataset
python -m scripts.dataset-stats --dataset data\train.json # training set
python -m scripts.dataset-stats --dataset data\test.json # test set
```


### DL experiments

Esempio train

```
python train.py log.tensorboard=True train.save_path=resnet50.pth
```

Esempio pca

```
python plot-pca.py --model resnet50.pth  --dataset dataset/oral/test.json
```
